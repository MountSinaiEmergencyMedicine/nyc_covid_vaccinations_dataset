# NYC COVID Vaccinations Dataset

This project is an ongoing collaboration with NYU for the CEAL project. The NYC DOHMH was publishing the data on this webpage - https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/covid/covid-19-data-vaccines.page. This page has changed the presentation and data format at least 5 times from starting in mid-February 2021 to May/June 2021. On May 9th, the denominator included more individuals than 18+ only. This projectâ€™s data ETL validation was updated and supported until May 23rd, when the DOHMH changed the page and data delivery schema. This May 23rd update coincided with the creation of a DOHMH GitHub page where the data is published in daily commits as seen at this page: https://github.com/nychealth/covid-vaccine-data/commits/main/people/coverage-by-modzcta-adults.csv

Data up until 6/23 - but data after 5/23 is not updated as per above:
